This repository exists for the purpose of the Intro to Programming class in the Software Development course. This is where the assignments for that class will be kept for use then and use later as portfolio material. 

My name is Cameron Hiatt. I am 22 years old and currently taking this program as of January 15th, 2020. I am married and living in Cedar City with my wife. I work at an telecommunications company partnered with Verizon here in Cedar City and am also a Twitch.tv live streamer for various video games. I enjoy modding and learning anything I can about the technology world.

I am taking this course in order to get the basics of coding down and as a jumpstart to becoming a programmer professionally. The current goal is to get hired initially at my brother-in-law's business upon completion of this program. As I am working there, I plan to be working on my current personal project which is to create a virtual reality program that I intend to build my own business around. With the help of my business partners Stockton and Magnus, I will build the software and organize the overall plan while Stockton takes care of the business logistics and details and Magnus does the graphic designs and virtual world textures for the program. My end goal is to successfully build this virtual reality business and spread to multiple locations across the country.
